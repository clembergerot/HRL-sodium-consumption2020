# HRL-sodium-consumption2020

This repository contains the work I have carried out under the supervision of Boris Gutkin at the Group for Neural Theory (Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris), during an internship in January-March 2020. It is an exploratory application of Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning to sodium-consumption behaviors in rats--and, in particular, to Jackson Cone's and colleagues' main experimental findings in *PNAS*, 2016. Our purpose was to show that an HRL model could predict qualitative features of the authors' data, so as to lay the groundwork for further, more quantitative analyses. This project is currently being continued and extended at the GNT, in Boris Gutkin's team. 

You can find the whole code and explanations in "HRL model of sodium-seeking behaviors in rats" (Jupyter Notebook).
